# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** Clicks and touches pass through the magnified content area to whatever app is underneath — the bubble enhances vision without blocking the workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation + DPI

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation + DPI)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-10 — Roadmap created, 46 v1 requirements mapped across 8 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Python 3.11.9 + tkinter + mss 10.1.0 + pywin32 311 + Pillow 11.3.0 + pystray 0.19.5 + PyInstaller 6.11.1 (from research/SUMMARY.md)
- Hotkey: `ctypes + user32.RegisterHotKey` directly (keyboard lib archived Feb 2026; pynput rejected for Win11 reliability)
- Resampling: Pillow BILINEAR (not LANCZOS) — 3–5x faster, needed for 30fps budget
- PhotoImage: single instance reused via `.paste()` — avoids CPython issue 124364 memory leak

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2**: Touch click-through (WM_NCHITTEST → HTTRANSPARENT) cannot be fully verified without clinic touchscreen hardware
- **Phase 6**: Ctrl+Z vs. Cornerstone undo conflict must be confirmed with user before ship; safer default Ctrl+Alt+Z available
- **Phase 8**: Clinic AV product unknown; budget time for allowlisting on target PC
- **Phase 1 / runtime**: Cornerstone (legacy LOB) may conflict with Per-Monitor-V2 DPI awareness — needs empirical test
- **Phase 5 / runtime**: `config.json` in app directory may be blocked by clinic IT; have `%LOCALAPPDATA%` fallback ready
