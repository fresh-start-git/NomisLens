# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-10)

**Core value:** Clicks and touches pass through the magnified content area to whatever app is underneath — the bubble enhances vision without blocking the workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation-dpi

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation-dpi) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Last completed: 01-02 (state + dpi) — 2026-04-11

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.10 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-dpi | 2 | 6 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3 min), 01-02 (3 min)
- Trend: flat (both plans 3 min)

*Updated after each plan completion*

**Plan detail:**

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| Phase 01-foundation-dpi P01 | 3 min | 3 | 8 |
| Phase 01-foundation-dpi P02 | 3 min | 2 | 4 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Python 3.11.9 + tkinter + mss 10.1.0 + pywin32 311 + Pillow 11.3.0 + pystray 0.19.5 + PyInstaller 6.11.1 (from research/SUMMARY.md)
- Hotkey: `ctypes + user32.RegisterHotKey` directly (keyboard lib archived Feb 2026; pynput rejected for Win11 reliability)
- Resampling: Pillow BILINEAR (not LANCZOS) — 3–5x faster, needed for 30fps budget
- PhotoImage: single instance reused via `.paste()` — avoids CPython issue 124364 memory leak
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi]: Kept src/magnifier_bubble/__init__.py at 0 bytes to prevent mss early-init DPI lock before main.py can set PMv2
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi]: Segregated runtime vs dev deps: requirements.txt is PyInstaller input (6 pkgs); requirements-dev.txt is superset with pytest
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi]: Deferred pyproject.toml [build-system]/[project] tables to Phase 8; Phase 1 pyproject is pytest config only
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi/02]: AppState uses threading.Lock (not RLock); observer notifications fire AFTER releasing lock; snapshot() returns deep copy via dataclasses.asdict round-trip
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi/02]: dpi.py has zero import-time side effects; lazy _u32() accessor + is_pmv2_active() guarded by sys.platform + try/except; SetProcessDpiAwarenessContext(-4) is main.py's job (Pattern 1), NEVER called from dpi.py
- [Phase 01-foundation-dpi/02]: is_pmv2_active() uses AreDpiAwarenessContextsEqual (not pointer identity) per research Pattern 3

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 2**: Touch click-through (WM_NCHITTEST → HTTRANSPARENT) cannot be fully verified without clinic touchscreen hardware
- **Phase 6**: Ctrl+Z vs. Cornerstone undo conflict must be confirmed with user before ship; safer default Ctrl+Alt+Z available
- **Phase 8**: Clinic AV product unknown; budget time for allowlisting on target PC
- **Phase 1 / runtime**: Cornerstone (legacy LOB) may conflict with Per-Monitor-V2 DPI awareness — needs empirical test
- **Phase 5 / runtime**: `config.json` in app directory may be blocked by clinic IT; have `%LOCALAPPDATA%` fallback ready
- **Phase 8 / packaging**: Dev box has Python 3.14.3 installed, not the research-specified 3.11.9. Phase 1 stdlib-only modules pass on 3.14.3 without issue, but PyInstaller 6.11.1 + mss 10.1.0 + pywin32 311 + Pillow 11.3.0 + numpy 2.2.6 wheel compatibility with 3.14 must be verified before Plan 03 (mss) or Phase 8 (packaging). Either install 3.11.9 side-by-side or confirm 3.14 wheels exist for all pinned deps.
